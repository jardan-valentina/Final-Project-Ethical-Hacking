<b>Ethical Hacking: Cyber Offense and Attack Strategies.</b>

The project goal is to demonstrate a portion of the router hacking process by showcasing specific attack vectors, such as phishing, WiFi hacking, brute force attacks on router web interfaces, DNS hijacking using Raspberry Pi, and fake access point creation using mini-routers.

<b>Note: </b>Project 4 was a group effort, and my role focused specifically on DNS hijacking using a Raspberry Pi.
